<ol>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">What is Javascript and why is it important for web development?</li>
    <p>Javascript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages. It is an essential part of web applications, allowing for dynamic content updates, form validation, and user interaction.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">How do you include JavaScript in an HTML element?</li>
    <p>Internal: In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags ,typically in the <head> or <body> section.</p>
    <p>External JavaScript: This is the most common and recommended approach for larger projects. JavaScript code is written in a separate .js file and linked to the HTML document using the src attribute of the script tag.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">What is the difference between var, let, and const?</li>
    <p>var is function-scoped, let is block-scoped, and const is also block-scoped but cannot be reassigned.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">How do you write comments in JavaScript?</li>
    <p>Single-line comments start with //, and multi-line comments are enclosed between /* and */.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">What are different data types available in JavaSScript?</li>
    <p>JavaScript has several built-in data types, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Primitive Types:
            <ul>
                <li>String: Represents textual data, e.g., "Hello, World!"</li>
                <li>Number: Represents numeric values, e.g., 42 or 3.14</li>
                <li>Boolean: Represents true/false values</li>
                <li>Undefined: A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value</li>
                <li>Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value</li>
                <li>Symbol: A unique and immutable primitive value, often used as object property keys</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reference Types:
            <ul>
                <li>Object: A collection of key-value pairs, e.g., { name: "Alice", age: 30 }</li>
                <li>Array: An ordered list of values, e.g., [1, 2, 3]</li>
                <li>Function: A callable object that can be invoked, e.g., function() { return "Hello"; }</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">What are variables, how do you declare them in JavaScript?</li>
    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Explain the difference between undefined and null.</li>
    <p>Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. Null is an assignment value that represents no value or no object.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">How do you check the data type of a variable in Javascript?</li>
    <p>You can check the data type of a variable using the typeof operator. For example, typeof variableName will return the data type of the variable.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">What are template literals, and how do you use them?</li>
    <p>Template literals are string literals that allow embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation with them. They are enclosed by backticks (``) instead of single or double quotes.</p>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Can you explain type coercion in JavaScript?</li>
    <p>Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. For example, when you add a number and a string, JavaScript converts the number to a string and concatenates them.</p>
